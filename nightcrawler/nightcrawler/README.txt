Hey everyone, this is the completed project from:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb8aad4MRx8 
(44: How to create a complete login system in PHP (READ DESC) | PHP tutorial | Learn PHP programming)

Everything worked for me. It is a pretty good overview of adding and getting stuff from a database.
We could definitely use the login scripts and stuff like that in our own project.
Sorry for naming it nightcrawler - that's just the folder name.

Also included is the file you can use in xampp to start up the database.

The database is currently incomplete - I'll add the other stuff to it in the next few days.

If you want to see the project actually work, start both apache and mysql in the XAMPP control panel.
Then go into a browser and type "localhost/nightcrawler" <- if you change the folder name just change the nightcrawler part.

Thanks
Nick
